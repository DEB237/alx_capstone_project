# Portfolio Website Project

## Project Overview
The portfolio website project is a website that showcases someone's skills, projects, and achievements. Its purpose is to serve as a professional online presence to showcase your work and attract potential employers or clients. It allows you to present your expertise, experience, and portfolio in a visually appealing and interactive manner.

This project aims to solve the problem of effectively presenting your work and skills to others in a concise and visually appealing way. It brings value to users by providing a centralized platform to highlight their achievements and capabilities, making it easier for potential clients or employers to assess their suitability for a particular job or project.

In this case, I'll create my own portfolio website.

- Skills Section: Highlight my technical skills and areas of expertise.
- Resume/CV: Provide a downloadable version of my CV for users to access.
- Contact Form: Allow visitors to contact me through a contact form for direct inquiries.

Users can navigate through the website using the menu and interact with different sections to learn more about your work and skills. Notable aspects or unique selling points could include a visually appealing design, smooth navigation, responsive layout for different devices, and interactive elements to engage visitors.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS: Structuring and styling the website.
- JavaScript: Adding interactivity and dynamic elements.
